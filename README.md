A Prototype System to easily load dynamic content from files. 

## Installation

The easiest to install is to just add this project as a submodule in your project.

Example usage in a Unity Project with git initialized:

1. Make sure your Unity Project is already in an initialized git project.

2. Open a Terminal window and type the following:

```
cd Path/of/UnityProject/Assets/Scripts
git submodule add git@github.com:flaviakim/PrototypeSystem.git
```

3. Add the required Newtonsoft Json Package to your Unity Project as explained [here](https://github.com/applejag/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity/wiki/Install-official-via-UPM#installing-the-package-via-upm-window)
